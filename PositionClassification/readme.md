## NBA Player Position Classification

This Python code classifies NBA players into five positions (SG, PG, SF, PF, and C) based on their per-game average performance in the 2020-2021 season. The dataset "NBAstats.csv" contains player statistics and is provided with the code. Using one classification method (Decision Tree/Naive Bayes/KNN/SVM), the model is trained on 75% of the data and tested on the remaining 25%. The accuracy of the model on both training and test sets is printed. Additionally, the confusion matrix for the classification model is displayed to assess its performance in a multi-class classification scenario. Further, the same classification model with the same parameters is evaluated using 10-fold stratified cross-validation. The accuracy of each fold is printed, along with the average accuracy across all folds.
